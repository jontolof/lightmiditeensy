# Light Midi with Teensy and TLC5947
This is a coding project using Teensy and 2 TLC5947, 24 channel PWM Drivers. It's a 48 diod light panel ranging 4 octaves.

## About Project
The TLC Drivers are required to set and maintain the light of the diods until explicitly turned off. Though hard to see in the video, the diods are velocity sensitive.
